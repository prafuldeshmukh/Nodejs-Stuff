  Check Queue :
  To queue a callback function into the check queue, we can use a function called setImmediate

  Experiment 8 Inference
  I/O queue callbacks are exected after microtasks queques callbacks and timer queue callbacks
  Polling I/O is a method of checking the status of a device or a data source at regular intervals,
   and performing an action if a certain condition is met. 
   For example, a microcontroller can poll a sensor to read its value, or poll a serial port to see if there is any data available.
*/
/*
  Experiment 8 Inference :
  I/O events are polled and callback functions are added to the i/o queue only after the i/o is complete.
