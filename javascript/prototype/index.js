/*
=> One object is trying to access method & propeties of other object is called inheritance
=> objects can inherit features from one another via prototypes. 

Every object has its own property called a prototype.

The prototype property allows you to add properties and methods to any object

Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype

Because the prototype itself is also another object, the prototype has its own prototype. This creates a something called prototype chain. The prototype chain ends when a prototype has null for its own prototype

- What is Prototype?
- What is Prototypal Inheritance?
- What is Prototype Chain?
- Why we call it _proto_ ?
